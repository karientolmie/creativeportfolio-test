“A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” This is a commonly heard phrase, and more commonly misquoted. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to go study and the whole experience was great but after leaving University, you quickly start to realize that nothing can ever fully prepare you **_adulting._**

Since 2015, I have worked in various jobs – some of which were internships (both in South Africa and the USA), whilst I was completing my Honours full time in 2016. Nothing really interested me, my motivation was fading and I was just working for the sake of getting “experience”. If anything, I learned how to deal with people in the workplace and how not to do things. Too many days were spent unhappy, full of anxiety, and countless hours lost in my traffic commute. I had enough and felt if I didn’t do something now, I may not have the opportunity again. I promised myself at 24, that from the age of **25 and up** I would stay true to myself.

**Anyway, moving on.** So how/why did we pick Thailand? In the last few months of my job, I was obsessing over Anthony Bourdain's travel series called “Parts Unknown”, and it was his show that convinced me to plan a trip to Asia. I had been saving for three years after all, so South East Asia was a must. Also, no visa required (again). Bali being our original choice and having planned the trip already but sadly we had to cancel when the volcano started becoming an issue. Definitely still high up on the bucket list.

>“It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I have still to go, how much more there is to learn. Maybe that’s enlightenment enough – to know that there is no final resting place of the mind, no moment of smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom, at least for me, means realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go.” – from No Reservations Season 2 Episode 3 (Peru).

This was my very first trip to Asia, and if you are looking for some inspiration to incorporate into your own journey, I hope this blog post will encourage you tto take action.

Since we had already lost a bit of money on booking our Bali adventures last year, we decided to go the route of a planned trip. Although if anything, I am an advocate for traveling with no plans. However, for our first Asia trip we booked the Thai Trio through [STA Travel](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiZ4d3B5u_qAhWVrHEKHYF-CYMQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statravel.co.za%2F&usg=AOvVaw2q7R7-i_olXFUXq8rt1cAJ) which I would highly reccomend them. This trip took us to Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.

All booked, now what?

I wanted to research everything and ensure it was perfect but I refrained since we already booked an organised trip.

**Packing tips:**

* Travel light – this means as little as clothes as possible, and even less shoes. Believe me, I only packed two pairs of sandals and my sneakers.
* Washing clothes there is easy and not too expensive – depending where you stay of course. Otherwise if you’re on a budget and well, not into shopping then pack a little laundry detergent and do some washing in the sink.
* Bug Spray – much need and often used.
* We traveled with only a backpack and our main suitcase, then packed an additional carry on bag for goodies we could bring back, which we didn’t even use. We spent most of our money on experiences and not things.
* Medication – a doctor’s appointment before you go to get some essentials for emergency cases. However, there are pharmacies all over if something ever does go wrong.
* Extra plastic bags – to separate dirty from clean laundry.
* Pack only essential toiletries just for the first week or so – the rest you can buy there and the price is all relevant.
* Remember active wear.
* Get cash beforehand and well, we had to draw several times in Thailand but it was fine. Also, remember to notify your bank that you are going abroad so that your card does not get blocked while using it there.
* Always keep spare copies of passport on hand – get them certified at the post office or at the police station before leaving.

> **Landing advice** With it being an organised trip, we asked for transportation to be included and well it definitely was a luxury after traveling for 10h 5min to Doha, 8h 35m layover, and 6h 55 min to Phuket, a total of 25 h 35 m. Landing in Phuket at 19:35 and being greeted by someone who could not speak English at all and was making use of google translate to communicate with us. However, before you rush off and get a cab – there are places as soon as you exit after collecting your luggage where you will be able to get your sim card. I don’t even need to explain it, it is really simple and cheap.

>**Budget** Going through STA travel, which included; flights, accommodation, breakfast and transport was an absolute treat. We knew that going to a country where English is scarce, we wanted to worry less, it being a vacation after all. We didn’t set a strict budget as we weren’t sure exactly of how much we were going to spend but we did ensure enough money in the bank in case of emergencies.
I estimated about R8000 is what I spent in total – gifts, food, experiences and additional transport. were all about the experience so ensure you save enough so you can do it all without worrying.

**Saving Tips:**

* Since we had breakfast included, ensure to eat a big breakfast and especially since you’re going to be walking around in the heat for most part of the day.
* Pack electrolyte sachets – we took them in the mornings too, especially on the airplane to avoid dehydration.
* Pack probiotics – we took them every night as you never know with the food you’re eating.
* Leave your shopping for the markets – this is where you find the best local and handmade goods.
* Massages – a bit overrated but definitely a must, you’ll find them on every corner.
* Before you purchase – do some scouting and then some bargaining as one might ask you 500 baht for a dress and the next place almost half for the exact same one.
* Drink local and eat local – a tip from the great Anthony Bourdain.
* Respect the law, Thailand is known to be very strict and you can easily get fined for something like not wearing your helmet whilst on a scooter or not having a certified copy of your passport with you on hand. Also, drugs – they are offered everywhere but I shouldn’t be having to tell you this anyway but get caught with drugs, well, you could spend quite a bit of jail time in Thailand.

## P H U K E T

**Best for:** Well, this depends where you stay and what you’re into. Most people say it is the best for partying which I can second but also, if it gets too much for you then you don’t need to stay near all the buzz i.e. Patong Beach & Bangla Road. One can go down further to the Cape. We did an afternoon trip here and it was extremely pleasant and breathtakingly beautiful.

**Activities:**
* Beach activities
* Day trips to the islands – there are people all around the island offering this but we used the company Diethelm Travel to do all our bookings.
* Beach Parties
* Street Food
* Temples
* Big Buddha
* Cashew Factory
* Gem Factory
* Bee Factory
* Elephant sanctuaries

**How we traveled:**  We used Diethelm travel to easily organize day trips but in between we just grabbed a random taxi, and went for it. Also, tuk tuks. Easy to use and they’re everywhere. With this hotel being a walk distance from Patong beach, we did plenty of walking and exploring by foot. However, if the heat gets too much for you then you can grab a tuk tuk or scooter taxi on every corner. Cash only of course.

**Scooter cost per day:**  We were a bit intimidated by all the traffic so we did not rent  a scooter here although after having rented one on the island (next destination), we will definitely do so in the future.

**Suggested time to stay here:**  We stayed 7 days, this was our longest stay and I feel 3-5 days would suffice to see and do plenty of the day trips.

**Accommodation:** Deevana Resort & Spa

**Thoughts:**  Although the area we stayed in was a bit overwhelming at first, we loved it nonetheless. It was a bit more secluded from the main road, and the fact that it was walking distance to the beach was a bonus.

**Tip:** There are places to hire a scooter real close by, although here you have to either pay a deposit of 5000TBH or hand in your passport. Pay the deposit rather if you wish to get a scooter.

# Phuket, day by day.

**Arrival**

Although we ended up only getting to the Resort after 20:00, we decided to grab some local food and try some local beer. Our first bill came to 790TBH – 4 beers, two main courses, and a plate of 4 spring rolls. The local beers – Signha & Chang, both equally good were 160TBH. The  more time you spend there you’ll start realizing when someone is over charging.

**Day 1**

We took advantage of sleeping in. We woke up to the sounds of rain, shocked that maybe we chose the wrong time to travel as it had said August is the beginning of Monsoon season…however, that was about the one and only time it really rained whilst there. Once we were up, we headed straight to the free breakfast and decided to walk to the beach – the humidity was a bit of a shock to the body but you soon get accustomed to it. We walked to the famous Bangla road where all things explicit happen, and then got some great Turkish wraps which we enjoyed on the beach. After enjoying our meal on the beach, we discovered Kudo Beach Club where we rested after the walk and treated ourselves to some local Beer (Singha) and myself, a Caprihana. Inspired by Anthony Bourdain. Later that afternoon we enjoyed our first coconut on the beach for only 50TBH. Thereafter, we decided to go out into town and explore the famous party road of Bangla Road. Where we had some good beer, enjoyed some live music, attempted pool and had way too much fried shrimp.
It really was interesting to experience, and well a massive culture shock to say the least. Amidst all the madness, they are still surprisingly strict with a low crime rate but the one thing that freaked me out the most was the fact there were old men with young girls – everywhere. They had obviously come to Thailand to live out their last few years. It was an unpleasant sight but I started realizing each to their own I suppose, who am I to judge.

**Day 2**

The day before we had read up about the various trips offered by Diethelm. In addition, as you land they give you a guide whom you can add on whats app – and ask anything as well as book through. We were up early and decided to do the Phuket Hai Sok City Tour, 1400TBH and from 7 – 13:00. First stop, elephant trekking (we did not ride them, only fed them – felt way too harsh to ride them in that heat), then the Cashew nut factory, a Bee Farm, Gem factory, Chalong Temple, feeding a baby elephant, Big Buddha, and ended it at an Orchid farm. This was only half day so we ended up relaxing at the resort before the half moon party at Paradise Beach, something we saw online. There is free transport from Patong beach to paradise beach club, so all we had to pay was the entrance fee.

**Day 3**

After an exhaustive second day and night, we took advantage of one of our many days to relax, enjoy the beach and hotel, as well as grab some great food at the place called Kudo Beach Club.

**Day 4**

Feeling refreshed and ready for another day of activities, we booked Phi Phi by speed boat, including 3 island stops and 7 sightseeing spots, at the cost of 1200TBH. The tour included the following; uncover the tropical landscape of Maya bay. Phi Phi Don beach side lunch, and spend your leisure time snorkeling and swimming at a secluded spot. First stop is Khai Nok island, Viking cave, Pileh lagoon, Losama Bay, Monkey bay.

Although the overall scenery was breathtaking, the actual island trip was a bit disappointing. This was mostly due to the influx of tourists, litter on the islands and just a general feeling of being rushed from one island to the next. Regardless of this, it was beautiful to see the various islands, but the stories behind most are a bit disheartening such as Maya Bay (famous in the movie “The Beach”) was closed by the government due to it having been destroyed by too many visitors. Also, monkey beach is also off limits as one can no longer feed the monkeys or the fish – as they have become too dependent on humans so the government has stopped that too, which is good. Overall, the snorkeling was amazing and the general trip was good but we decided not to do another one to the other islands like James Bond. We ended the day at Naught Nuri, where they have the most amazing ribs also someone sings to you when they deliver your food.

**Day 5**

Another rest day, we spent the morning exploring by foot, going to local shops, getting some good coffee and just soaking up the holiday sun. As you walk down the streets, someone is always offering you a taxi. We decided to just ask, and well the guy gave us his number and said we must just call when we need him. We gave him a time and he was at the hotel later that afternoon. As we got in, he took us to some back dodgy area, but then he said my friend will take you as he lives that side anyway – Mr Kong was his name. It worked out, and we made it to the beautiful Promthep Cape, with views to die for. We then took the tuk tuk back, sharing a ride with a young Chinese couple and stopped over at Kata Beach. Dinner was at sky bar (search google maps) after which we grabbed a random taxi to Patong bay and just walked the last few blocks back to the hotel.

**Day 6**

Exploring by foot, beach day and dinner at the 9th floor restaurant.

**Day 7**

Flight at 13:00 to Koh Samui  aka paradise.

## K O H   S A M U A I

**Best for:** All things island life. It was everything and more that we wanted. Ocean view hotel, good food, and not as busy. I feel this is where we fully immersed ourselves in the Thai Culture – renting a scooter, trying different Thai food, and exploring the island by ourselves.

**Activities:**

* Temples
* Other island day trips
* Secret Buddha Garden
* Waterfalls
* Elephant sanctuaries
* Cooking classes

![alt text](/img/photos/thailand/scooter.JPG)

**How we traveled:** Organised with Diethelm Travel for airport transfers, best option for traveling with luggage and then via Scooter everywhere else.

**Suggested time to stay here:**  Forever. Well okay, we were there for 4 days but I could happily have stayed there longer.

**Accommodation:** Ibis Bophut – good food, good location, clean rooms and ocean views.

**Thoughts:**  This place was my favourite, not only because I got ENGAGED but because it is very much the simple life here and one can seriously just relax, be present and fully immerse yourself with the Thai locals

# Koh Samui, day by day.

**Arrival**

We had to take a short flight from phuket, landing at a private owned airport in Koh Samui. After settling in we grabbed some food and drinks at the hotel. We then took a walk to the Night Market Bophut / Fishermans Village where we had the most amazing sun downers at Coco Tams, and the  most amazing Thai green curry at Krua Bophut.

**Day 8**

Time to rent a scooter! We walked about 5km in the heat to get to the scooter rental shop [Madame & Makdame.](https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Attraction_Review-g1179396-d12962981-Reviews-Madame_Makdame-Bophut_Ko_Samui_Surat_Thani_Province.html) Unpleasant at first but so worth it because you see more by foot. As soon as we got the scooter, we went straight to the temple and did a trip to the Tan Rua Waterfall, and then drove up into the mountains to discover the Secret Buddha garden. That evening we went back to explore the Bophut Fishermans village – it was a Saturday night, and there were plenty of people. We stopped to get out of the buzz – to enjoy some good wine and oysters.

**Day 9**

Time for more exploring on the scooter! We did some sightseeing at Wat Plai Laem but the heat got a bit too much so we spent the day relaxing. After we had cooled down, we decided to hop back onto the scooter and then go to the Jungle club for a cocktail. Then the big night, he proposed to me at the beautiful Hansar Resort.

**Day 10**

Enjoying the last of the few hours with our scooter, and then spending the afternoon by the pool before our next destination.

## B A N G K O K

**Arrival**

As we landed at the airport, we were a bit shocked. Coming from the stress free island life of Koh Samuai, the city left us feeling a bit uncomfortable and well, we never really adjusted to it. Our accommodation was average and I think we were just exhausted, so 3 days was a bit too much. We were pleased with the hotel service and friendly the staff, so friendly that the bell man offered to drive us to the floating markets for free (we tipped of course). He told us many stories from his culture, about how he has to pay extra for his kids to learn English at school, how he still believes that eating tigers gives you strength (he came from a small village in northern Thailand), and how his wife sews clothes for a living (the more she sews the more money she gets).

**Best for:**  Night markets and shopping.

I know it is each to their own as the saying goes but my hope is to educate others through my travels, but you have to be willing to learn and be open minded for there to actually be change. Another recommendation is by DW Documentary and how [mass tourism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78xdMXOx7Rw) is negatively impacting places like Thailand. Another good source of inforamtion is [Poached: Inside the Dark World of Wildlife Trafficking](https://www.amazon.com/Poached-Rachel-Love-Nuwer-audiobook/dp/B07HKN6123/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=poached+rachel&qid=1595935211&s=audible&sr=1-1)
