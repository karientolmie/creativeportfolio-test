Most people would prefer to go to an island for their honeymoon but my dream has always been to go to Portugal, so I was beyond excited when my husband surprised me with tickets to Lisbon!

We stayed at [Hotel Vincci Baixa](https://www.vinccibaixa.com/) in the Alfama district. After a lot of research, and talking to friends who had been there this was a great choice for such a short visit.

## LISBON TO SINTRA

We arrived in Lisbon with ease, and having rested well on the previous flight we decided to take the uber drivers advice and head to Sintra for the day.

We walked to the Rossio Railway Station, located in the Rossio square. Getting a ticket can be daunting at first but there is English signage everywhere so you quickly figure it out.

Using google maps to make our way to the castle, we quickly realized we were not dressed warm enough for the chilly November weather. If we were, I would have most definitely walked through the Parque das Merendas but instead we grabbed a tuk tuk to the top, which was actually quite the ride and not too expensive at all so depending on how much time you have you can make the decision.We grabbed lunch at [Dona Maria](https://www.vinccibaixa.com/), with amazing views over the valley. We arrived back quite late and ended up having an early night so we could take day 2 head on again.

## NAZARÉ

We made an impulsive decision the night before to take the [bus](https://www.vinccibaixa.com/) to Nazare, buying the tickets online and booking our airbnb.

Travelling by bus reminded me of my 2015 travels through Europe (blog still to come). After wandering in endless circles, we eventually found our quaint little airbnb. Shortly after we were on our way again, seeking seafood.  We stumbled upon [Taberninha](http://taberninha/) where we hand picked our fish, and my husband has some Octopus for the first time.

## NAZARÉ TO LISBON

The first time I ever saw my husband wake up before me, was to witness the World's biggest waves. Due to a broken phone we lost almost all the video footage but luckily I saved some photos. We prepared ourselves the night before with our backpacks, and did an early morning hike up the hill to the [Sitio de Nazaré](http://taberninha/) where we were some of the first people to arrive - witnessing breathtaking surf scenes with professional surfers from around the World. Follow [gigantesdenazare](http://taberninha/) for some great footage.

Once it was getting too bus, we decided to take a walk back down the hill. We grabbed some local Sagres beer and had some of the famous bifana - a traditional Portuguese sandwich. It is prepared with a Portuguese bread roll and very thin marinated pork cutlets. I know this because of my obsession with [Anthony Bourdain](https://explorepartsunknown.com/) (no reservations is another great TV show by him) and more recently, [Somebody feed Phil](https://philrosenthalworld.com/somebody-feed-phil-lisbon/) on Netflix. Portugal was a lot cheaper than Ireland, we could actually have a couple of beers and didn't have to share as much as we did in Ireland.

We then headed to the bus station where we waited for the bus back to Lisbon and grabbed some dinner at [Boa-Bao.](https://www.boabao.pt/)

## LISBON

Back in Lisbon, we decided to explore by foot. We made our way to some tourist spots but the journey to them was actually more beautiful than anything else we had experienced. Meandering through the streets of Lisbon, and along the water banks. We stopped at the following places;

  > * Pasteis de Belem
    * Time out food market
    * Castelo de S. Jorge for sunset
    * [Tasca Do Chico](https://www.facebook.com/atasca.dochico/S) as per Anthony Bourdains recommendations
    * [A Cultura do Hambúrguer](https://www.aculturadohamburguer.pt/) for dinner

## LAST DAY IN LISBON

We spent the day, walking all over the Alfama district. Getting stuck in the rain, eating way too many Pastéis de Nata and then ending up at [Confraria LX](https://confrariasushi.pt/) for dinner. A sushi experience that was out of this World.

Portugal has left me wanting more, and I will most definitely be going back to explore more of the coasts as well as cities like Porto. In addition, visiting Spain is high up on the list. Watch this space.
