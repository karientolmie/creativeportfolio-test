At the time it had been 4 years since my last visit to Ireland, and 6 months since our trip to Thailand. As April holidays were nearing, and with the abundance of public holidays in South Africa as well as our limited passports, Ireland was high on the list. Ireland is one of the few places (excluding Northern Ireland) which us South Africans can travel to without having to go through a tedious and expensive visa application process.

Back in 2015 I was able to do some work in Dublin, and create memories with my parents by traveling around the coast for about 10 days. I quickly fell in love with Ireland and continued to obsess over it for the years to come.

Booking advice: Rather than booking all your accommodation at once or in the same place, just book the first few days. I am pro airbnb, and supporting locals is the way to truly experience a country. Not to say that a hotel every now and then can be a treat, enjoying some room service and all the perks does have its advantages. Also, creating a travel itinerary as a back-up to show passport control is recommended even if it is visa free.

Great, moving on. In terms of what to pack? We went in August/September during 2015 and apparently it is the only time in the year they get sunshine but having gone in April the second time, we did experience a lot more rain (which I love).

Here are some quick packing tips that might help:

* You are in Europe and one of the most expensive cities, so I would not recommend buying clothes there unless deemed necessary.
* We were well off with just a couple of long pants, long sleeve shirts, coats, scarf, beanie and the usual. Scratch all the fancy jackets, blouses, dresses and all that because when you're walking 20 000 plus steps a day around Dublin all you’ll be worried about is staying warm, dry and comfortable.
* Staying in an airbnb for the most part, the Irish (friendliest people I’ve ever met) allowed us to do washing so you’ll always find a way to manage.
* Pack an extra bag for dirty clothes for when you travel back (or for any purchases made) but who needs more stuff when you can spend money on experiences and not things.
* Zip lock bags are a must, for all toiletry products and something I’ve always done is to put some laundry detergent in a zip-lock bag for when you run out of underwear or socks.
* Toiletries, only pack essentials because you can buy that abroad rather than travelling with products that might leak.
* When getting a travel case, be mindful of your way of traveling because the heavier your bag, the heavier your commute. We quickly learned that having a pull suitcase was not ideal when you’re trying to walk around Dublin, and running to try catch a train.

> Airplane advice: I always pack a small skin care pack (face wipes, moisturizer, and some lip balm) just to keep you feeling fresh, and more lively after being cramped up for so long. Mints and bubblegum are key, as well as staying hydrated. We always take re-hydration sachets with, drink a lot of water, and regularly get up to walk. To add onto this, getting a sim card upon arrival is your first step in any country for making phone calls if necessary and the best app in the World, google maps. Unlike Thailand where no one spoke English, everything was a breeze in Ireland. We got our sim card, our Leap cards (all public transport) and were quickly on our way to our airbnb.

> Budget advice: While most of it is relevant and accommodation wise we felt satisfied with what we were paying. When it came to food, beverages, and entrance fees we were a bit shell shocked. Dublin is one of the most expensive cities I’ve traveled to but my advice would be to go to the local grocery store, get some snacks for breakfast rather than eating out three times a day. Unlike Thailand where we could eat out more regularly, shop (most days), Ireland might feel a bit restrictive but like I said, there is so much to see and ways around not having to spend a ridiculous amount of Euros on things like fine dining (unless you're into it).

The best way to explore Dublin is by foot, although there are trains and trams everywhere I find it better to stumble upon hidden gems.

Things to do:

* Trinity College Gardens and the Book of Kells.
* St Stephens Green.
* [Brother Hubbard](https://brotherhubbard.ie/locations/) for breakfast or lunch.
* National museum of Ireland.
* Dublin castle ( In 2015 I was fortunate enough to attend a dinner inside the castle with breathtaking Irish dancers and food. I am still considering writing about my 2015 trip, but I'll list a few other key moments from this trip at the end).
* [Freshii](https://www.freshii.com/ca/en-ca/home) for lunch
* Phoenix Park, it’s massive so maybe rent a bike. I ended up walking around, getting a coffee & croissant at the Phoenix Park tea room. Also, they have deer there so go find them.
* Irish museum of modern art.
* Jameson distillery, although expensive you can just sit at the bar and enjoy some unique drinks.
* And of course a night out to a temple bar, and the surrounding pubs. Live **Irish music is everywhere!**

It was time to check out in Dublin, but being Easter weekend we didn’t think we would struggle so much with renting a car. Dragging our bags across Dublin, going back and forth between places just to find out that the only cars available to rent were way out of our price range. We then decided to catch the [Irish](https://www.irishrail.ie/) rail across the country to Dublin. Note that it is cheaper to buy the tickets online than at the station.

> Side note: Taxis & ubers were actually quite scarce, and sometimes you have to pre-order so you can end up waiting and in our case missing the early train.

Nonetheless, we made it to Sligo. The hotel was walking distance from the Train/Bus Station.

Things to do:

* We wondered around, admired some of the great artwork all over Sligo, had a couple beers, and then stumbled upon [Hooked](https://hookedsligo.ie/), the best fish and chips we had in Ireland.
* Grab breakfast at Knox
* [The Queen Maeve trail](http://gostrandhill.com/explore/hikes-walks/queen-maeve-trail/) for some decent hiking, average intensity but so many great views so you can stop regularly to catch your breath if need be.
* After the hike, grab some lunch at the beach - [Strandhill bar](http://www.thestrandbar.ie/)

> Tip: Buy some water & snacks at the local grocery store before you start hiking as there are some breathtaking views at the top. There is one near the entrance of the trail.

Next up, Donegal! We were booking our airbnb, and planning our trip day to day. We booked our Bus Eireann tickets online, and our airbnb so we were ready to go to Donegal

Accommodation: [Sligo City Hotel](Next up, Donegal! We were booking our airbnb, and planning our trip day to day. We booked our Bus Eireann tickets online, and our airbnb so we were ready to go to Donegal)

Suggested time to stay there: 2 days

One of my favorite places in Ireland, and the closest to Northern Ireland I have ever been. At the airport we were questioned about visas to Northern Ireland but thankfully my itinerary convinced them that we were aware and would not be entering Northern Ireland at all. Also, one of my favorite airbnb experiences in Ireland. We felt extremely welcome, and the owner even took us on a road trip the following day (at a small fee) and let us do our washing there. You’ll see this in a few places, but they use something called Irish Peat Briquettes as an alternative to logs and coal for heating.

Things to do:

* Donegal Castle
* The fairy bank river walk
* Grab some Irish stew at the [Olde Castle Bar & Red Hugh's Restaurant](http://www.oldecastlebar.com/)
* Slieve League, a mountain on the Atlantic coast of County Donegal with breathtaking stops on the way. Note that it is free entrance unlike Cliffs of Moher (although we went) it is also three times higher.

Back to Sligo we go, having rented a car online and for much cheaper than we would have got in in Dublin. Let the road trip commence!

On route we stopped over in Easky, a famous surf spot. I won’t go into detail of every place we stopped in but rather places that stood out. Next was the stunning Dún Briste (Broken Fort) Sea Stack which stands just off Downpatrick Head in County Mayo.

We arrived in Westport (once rated the best place to live in Ireland) in awe of our garden airbnb and again, with friendly hosts who dropped us in town for dinner at no cost. We wondered around, and satisfied our Italian food craving at [Il Vulcano Restaurant](https://www.ilvulcano.ie/)  

Things to do:

* Westport House & Hotel Westport (heritage site)
* Matt Molloy’s

If I could buy a house in Ireland, it would be here.

Making our way to good old Dingle, we stopped in Lahinch Beach for some amazing views. Ireland just kept showing off its beauty. In order to save some time, we took the [Shannon Ferry](https://www.shannonferries.com/?source=googleads&medium=hopkins&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgJv4BRCrARIsAB17JI6hLFTbhG3ktdrPhKGCYzjxpBDk6f58gfliaImU10vJrmA6YGw5rQUaAmS7EALw_wcB) to get to Dingle faster. Dingle is a picturesque town, with many great cafes such as [Bean in Dingle](http://www.beanindingle.com/) and a must is Murphy's ice cream. We bought some, and went to sit in the harbor to enjoy it

> My least favorite, would not recommend but back in 2015 we stayed in a beautiful B&B which is no longer available, but [booking.com](http://booking.com/) has many options or try a different airbnb.

Due to a storm being on route, we decided not to head further South in case our rental car got damaged.

I truly fell in love with this airbnb, and it’s location. We felt completely relaxed and comfortable with the home like airbnb. An ideal way to draw our Ireland adventure to an end.

Back to Dublin we go. Driving through the breathtaking Wicklow Mountain National Park and stopping at the famous Sally's gap from PS I love you as well as Glendalough (renowned for an Early Medieval monastic settlement). In 2015 I visited the Powerscourt Estate, a must see as well.

To end our trip, we spent some time in Phoenix Park again and then used our rental car for the last time to drive to Howth for some amazing seafood tapas at [Octopussy.](http://octopussys.ie/)

We had an early flight the next day, so dropping off our car at the airport with Hertz and having them drop off us off at the hotel was a breeze. Farewell Ireland, until next time.
