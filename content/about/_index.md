**twenty5up** since @2018

A proud South African traveller with a deep love for the environment, and a focus on sustainability. Al though my ancestors are mainly Scottish, German as well as Dutch, I sadly only have the "green mamba" passport.

  > Sustainability in all its forms such as food, fashion, agriculture and mainly tourism.

My mission is two fold. One, to inform and equip people with the knowledge as well as confidence to travel not only more regularly but to travel in a way that is sustainable. Two, inspiring South Africans to travel to the various visa free destinations.

  > Through highlighting ways in which we can enjoy this beautiful world without detriment as well as encouraging a broader view and understanding of the World we live in.

This blog will be purely be based on the following;

 * travel
 * photography
 * food
 * research
 * conservation
 * organic farming
 * supporting local business
 * education
 * outreach
 * outdoor activities
**_and more..._**

  > Using my powers to bring about a greater social good.
